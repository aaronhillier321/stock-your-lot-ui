# Login App

UI application for stock your lot.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview

The login form is demo-only (shows an alert on submit). Replace the `setTimeout` logic in `src/Login.jsx` with your real authentication (e.g. API call or auth provider).
